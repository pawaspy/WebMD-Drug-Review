<h1>WebMD Drug Analysis</h1>

**GOAL**

To build a machine learning model for predicting the drug analysis.

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/rohanharode07/webmd-drug-reviews-dataset

**DESCRIPTION**

To analyze the dataset of drugs and build and train the model on the basis of different features and variables.

There are 2 types of datasets:

- `columns_descriptions`: This dataset contains the description of all the features.
- `support2`: This dataset contains 362000 entries with 13 different features.

## About the WebMD Drug Dataset

* Drug (categorical): name of drug.
* DrugId (numerical): drug id.
* Condition (categorical): name of condition.
* Review (text): patient review.
* Side (text): side effects associated with drug (if any).
* EaseOfUse (numerical): 5 star rating.
* Effectiveness (numerical): 5 star rating.
* Satisfaction (numerical): 5 star rating.
* Date (date): date of review entry.
* UsefulCount (numerical): number of users who found review useful.
* Age (numerical): age group range of user.
* Sex (categorical): gender of user.

This dataset intended to answer following questions:

1. Identifying the condition of the patient based on drug reviews?
2. How to predict drug rating based on patientâ€™s reviews?
3. How to visualize drug rating, kind of drugs, types of conditions a patient can have, sentiments based on reviews?

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Load the dataset which contains 362000 entries in it and having 13 columns in it.
* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly.
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Plotting heatmap using correlation and checking the relation between different features.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with target variable using plotting libraries.
* Train the datasets by different models and saves their accuracies into a dataframe.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Sklearn
4. NumPy
5. XGBoost
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras
8. Sci-py
9. Seaborn
10. CatBoost
11. LightGBM

**CONCLUSION**

- Random Forest and Cat Boost Regressor and Light GBM Regressor models show promising performance with lower MSE and higher R2 values.
- Decision Tree Regressor achieved very high MSE and very low R2 on the training set. This shows the model can't be used for the drug analysis.
- Other models such as SVR, XGBoost, Gradient too performed good on the training and testing data which shows these model can be used.
